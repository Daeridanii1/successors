# Successor Masterdoc
This file is intended to lay out the various lore and worldbuilding elements I am trying to build the Successors with.

## **Physicality**
I have affectionally referred to the Successors as "frogtopi" in that the basis from their design springs from a combination of amphibian and cephalopod traits. The basic body plan is that of a invertebrate body with a "head" at one end with two eyes and eight muscular arms at the other, which are used for movement and object manipulation. Adults stand modestly taller than humans; between two and three meters, with significant variation between individuals. 

Successor skin is moist and mucosal, and like octopi, they are capable of changing the color and texture of their skin. This ability can be used for camouflage, but in modern Successor society, is primarily a communicative method: you can tell what mood a Successor is in by what color they are. With regard to story and dialogue, this is an important note.

Successors are amphibious; like frogs, they breathe through their skin and are comfortable both underwater and on land. While on land, they are most comfortable in a moist environment, and becoming dried-out can be dangerous or lethal to them. Architecture is designed around this: the interiors of buildings are humid, floors are covered in thin layers of water, etc. They are comfortable in colder temperatures than humans: environmentally-conditioned areas will probably be in the range of 0-10 Celsius (32-50 Fahrenheit).

Successors are a hermaphroditic species; adult individuals do not differ in their sexual capabilities, and they have no distinct sex. In a societal sense, this means there are no distinct gender roles or norms; from a narrative standpoint, this means all Successors are referred to in gender-neutral terms.

## **Society**

### *Introduction*
Successor society is highly family-centric. In general, Successors have large, tightly-knit families, and one's belongingness to one's family is considered the most important belongingness of all. 

The Successor political structure is an extension of this. I would characterize it as a "somewhat representative aristocracy." The largest political units are the High Houses: the noble families of the Successors and their associated supporters. Nominally, inclusion in the "supporters" part of this includes some degree of blood relation, but practically, in the modern day the bar for inclusion is lower, as the Houses vying for power want the largest group of supporters possible. That being said, this is still along the lines of "family," and so children of those belonging to one of the High Houses become members themselves by default. As a consequence, many Successors are members of multiple of the High Houses, even if those Houses might be politically or socially in conflict. This is part of the reason for the unique political situation present in Successor society by the time of the player's arrival; the High Houses are highly disincentivized against open warfare against each other because their popular support is shared with their competitors.

The High Houses are still highly aristocratic despite this popular element. Those in control, generally referred to as Scions, are those belonging to the core supposedly-unbroken bloodline of the House; a single House may have around a dozen---parents, children, siblings, etc, who belong to the current generation of the core of the family. In practice, this is a little more complex: the Houses are supported by complex bureaucracies that wield significant power and influence. These consist of advisors, representatives, trusted military members, and more distant relatives. That being said, it is almost always the case that the Scions wield more power than mere figureheads, even if their power is generally not absolute.

The High Houses *do* have a popular element, though. While the Scions and bureaucracy hold power within the House, it is the support and taxation of their general members that allow them to wield and project external power. By the start of the player's involvement in their story, the remaining High Houses are divided into two loose alliances: the Old Houses and the New Houses.

### *Old and New Houses*

The High Houses in the star cluster the main part of the story takes place in are grouped in the Old Houses in the north, and the New Houses in the south. The history behind this division goes as such: the modern Successor territory is a small part of their historical empire, which collapsed ca. 2000 years prior. During that collapse, the High Houses that relocated to the area as refugees were declared the "New Houses," and those which were already established in the territory were the "Old Houses." This is complicated further because, in general, the New Houses are older than the Old Houses; they hail from the central parts of the empire and were therefore historically more powerful and established than the Old Houses, which were comparatively less prestigious and relegated to the ege of the empire.

By the modern day, the Old Houses are generally the group "in control"; when the two groups come into conflict, the general situation is that the Old Houses are the government and the New Houses are the opposition. The New Houses control a smaller and less comfortable territory with fewer natural resources, a smaller population, and on average a slightly poorer citizenry and aristocracy. It's worth noting that this is not a large or sharp division; the New Houses are societally disadvantaged, but ultimately not by much, and they generally make up for their slightly lower wealth and manufacturing volume by being more efficient and intentional with their governance.

Each House controls its own planet, and each of the groups (Old and New) control a collective planet as part of their alliance, where no individual House has specific authority.

### *The Old Houses*

**House Aqrabe**

Of all the Old Houses, House Aqrabe is the most neutral. They are seated at the temperate moon of Mavra-Sol-Kvel, and have a strong commercial economy built on trade flowing through their system, involving both the Old and New Houses as well as the general Successors. Because of their relative neutrality, they often work together with House Kaatrij in a sort of peacemaking coalition.

**House Sioeora**

The smallest of the Old Houses, House Sioeora controls the far northern planet of Staja-Kella-Oa. They are strongly connected to the educational institutions of Staja-Kella-Oa, which take a particular interest in history and the sciences and are generally regarded as the best in Successor space. While Sioeora cannot compare with the economic might of the other Old Houses, they serve as the cultural core of the group, preserving Successor history and spearheading the Old Houses' cultural and scientific development efforts, which grants them significant influence.

Staja-Kella-Oa once was home to a sapient race circa 100 000 years prior to the events of the story, at which time they went extinct.

Sioeora lend the player the translation device that allow them to communicate with the Successors.

**House Chydiyi**

Chydiyi is the richest of the Old Houses, with an economy based primarily on their position as the strongest manufacturing powerhouse in Successor space. Their seat of power is the material-rich Khora-Vasa-Reyyaa, where they have long-established mining and manufacturing projects. They are also the most militarized of the all the High Houses, contributing a majority of the Old Houses' collective fleet in exchange for a significant financial inflow from their allies.

Because of their significant military and economic power over the other High Houses, Chydiyi is considered the *de facto* leader of the four.

Because Khora-Vasa-Reyyaa is the most material-rich planet in Successor space, House Chydiyi is bound by several treaties that guarantee its continued raw material exports to the other High Houses, both Old and New.

**House Myurej**

Myurej represents the largest population of any of the High Houses in Successor space, concentrated on its familial home of Raaqa-Kvelq-Ryuit. Like Aqrabe, it enjoys an economy built on the taxation of trade passing through its system and of the diverse incomes of its members. It is also the oldest of the Old Houses. 

### *The New Houses*

**House Seineq**

Seated on the planet of Yoqqa-Vasa-Vasa, House Seineq is the wealthiest and most powerful of the New Houses. They are also most proximate to the New Houses' council moon of O-Vasa-Oa (as it orbits their home planet). Seineq also operates the majority of the New Houses' shipyards.

**House Haeora**

House Haeora represents the largest population among the New Houses, with a strong services-based economy centered on its home planet of Moliia-Cosa-Vasa.

**House Kvasq**

Kvasq mirrors Chydiyi with an economy based on extraction and manufacturing from its seat of power on Kasii-Cavasaa-Oa. They are highly self-sufficient; while they are still connected to the other New Houses politically and economically, and generally a predictable member of that alliance, they do so more out of expedience and utility than any sense of unity.

**House Kaatrij**

Seated on the rainy planet of Raaqa-Puan-Uuoru, House Kaatrij has perhaps the most interesting story of any of the High Houses. Unlike the rest, they do not claim an unbroken lineage since their founding, but instead recognize that during the collapse, all the Scions eventually died without direct heirs. To continue the House, many of the refugees from the collapsing Houses that did not escape the bedlam of the central empire, were brought into the fold and inducted as full members of the house and its family.

In the present day, Kaatrij remains the smallest of all the High Houses, and it has little direct influence outside its home system. However, it has earned a reputation as efficient and adaptable, and serves as a center of education and high-tech research and development in the south of Successor space.

Because of its more democratic and egalitarian history, it incorporates a more diverse leadership and tends to be the most neutral of the New Houses in general conflicts with the Old.


## Technology

From the standpoint of Endless Sky's classification system, the goal is for the Successors to stand on roughly the same level as the Wanderers at around tier 2.2.

## **History**
*NOTE: The details of Successor history are still pretty undefined---this is something I'd like to work towards solidifying in continued development of the project. So consider what follows to be the current working premise; details subject to change.*

Dominating the history of the Successors are, unsurprisingly, their Predecessors, who formed an empire in the galactic North that persisted until about the year 1700, when the radiation produced by the eruption of the star Eta Carinae several thousand years earlier began to encroach on their core territories, causing widespread famine, infertility, and infrastructural damage, leading to an eventual collapse. It's worth noting that this is supposed to be a slow, quiet downfall: the collapse did not happen overnight but over dozens or hundreds of years.

At its peak, the empire of the Predecessors was both technologically and socially advanced, with an upper caste of nobles enjoying primarily ceremonial power over a larger population of commoners, who, while they lacked noble status, were generally wealthy, healthy, and both economically and socially mobile. At the time of the collapse, the empire extended far enough south for there to be extensive records of observations of humanity and the Sol system at that time.

During the collapse, many of the noble houses stored away their wealth and technology for safe keeping, with the expectation that they would be able to flee and then retrieve it once the situation was safe again. However, the persistent radiation threat from Eta Carinae and violent anger toward the nobility from the residents of the irradiated territories who did not have the money to leave made this impossible.

Those noble families that did escape the bedlam did so through an unstable wormhole leading to the star cluster the Successors now inhabit. Since travel through this wormhole was contingent on the possession of a quantum keystone, which only the wealthy could afford, it served as a filter such that only the high-born and a lucky few commoners made it to the cluster. There they came into conflict, both with each other, and with the noble families who had immigrated to the cluster through the wormhole prior. What had before seemed like a vast expanse of new land and territory was now in very high demand. Many of the already-established families demanded the newly arriving ones give up their titles, and since most of the arriving nobles did not have the military might to oppose the established ones, they were forced into servile positions, or at the very least, to positions of limited power and authority. This serves as the basis between the modern conflict between the Old and New Houses.
