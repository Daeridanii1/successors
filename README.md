## The Successors

Welcome to the development repository for the Successors, a work-in-progress alien faction for the open-source space game [Endless Sky](https://www.github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky), currently in the plugin format but intended for the base game.

The Successors currently occupy their own map region in the far galactic south-southwest. Several missions are implemented, along with a full roster of ships and outfits, some of which can be obtained through normal gameplay via a short introductory storyline. 

All-content plugin support for testing and development is provided by [Omnis](https://www.github.com/DarcyManoel/-Omnis).

For more information on lore and worldbuilding, please consult [the "masterdoc"](docs/masterdoc.pdf).

> [!NOTE]
> This is a development repository; you are free to use this plugin as part of "story" or "legitimate" gameplay, but the Successors' ships, outfits, missions, and map presence are subject to change.
