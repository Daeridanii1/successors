	description `The Bimodal Railgun was designed quite simply as a perfect weapon, and indeed, it is said that by the time the empire of the Predecessors fell, they had seen no need to install any other weapon on their ships for over a thousand years.`
	description `It fires a condensed packet of heavy metal ions that disperse as they travel: up close the concentrated bolt pierces armor, while at a distance the ionic spray destabilizes shielding. Together, a ship equipped with these can adjust its damage profile just by changing its engagement range, allowing it to be highly effective against any foe.`

	description `Successor warships have traditionally relied on fixed weaponry to deal with their foes, but the High Houses do produce a turreted version of the Bimodal Railgun so that their larger and slower vessels can maintain their combat effectiveness against more manuverable targets. It mounts two railguns side by side, rigged to fire double the amount of shots per burst to keep them in sync with the fixed hardpoints.`

	description `The Successors have a historical affinity for projectile weaponry which persists to the modern day. The Shatter Cannon fires a short-ranged, highly inaccurate blast of projectiles that not only deal substantial damage but also temporarily disrupt the target's engines.`
	description `While it is an inelegant design in comparison to the time-tested Bimodal Railgun, and consequently less appreciated, the Shatter Cannon has found a place on the Successors' fast attack craft primarily as a tool for slowing down enemy vessels so that they can be engaged by a larger fleet.`

	description "This shield-penetrating laser is one of the few weapons manufactured independently in Successor space, rather than under the auspices and restrictions of the High Houses. As a consequence of this, it is neither especially powerful nor efficient, but its low cost and space requirements make it a nonetheless relatively appealing defensive choice for those without access to the High Houses' more potent weaponry."

	description "The invention of the Pulse Laser was a wake-up call for the more astute in the High Houses, as it was the first time in hundreds of years that weapons were being manufactured by groups other than themselves. Most Successors see the turreted version as a continuation of this democratization of violence, while the more paranoid claim that the High Houses have infiltrated production and intentionally sabotaged the design."

	description `Unable to access large quantities of the high-quality weaponry produced by the High Houses, the "People's Houses" have had to work with what's available to them: mostly the relatively low-powered pulse lasers produced independently in Successor space. This pulse laser has had its safeties bypassed and its optics upgraded, allowing it to do more damage at a higher rate of fire in exchange for requiring more power and producing much more heat.`

	description `Hand-crafted by the more colorful members of the People's Houses, this bespoke overcharged Pulse Laser turret is tuned to fire even faster than the fixed version, producing a truly prodigious amount of heat for a weapon of its size. Despite its crude design, it is nonetheless a fearsome weapon, especially considering that it retains the ability to partially punch through shielding.`

	description "Rather than a conventional explosive payload, Corrosive Torpedoes carry a highly volatile gel that reacts violently with the metal that makes up a ship's hull. They are very powerful against unshielded targets, but their lack of direct damage makes them ineffective while a target's shields are active. In order to ensure that the torpedoes reach their target, they are fired in bursts of three."

	description "The Burst Anti-Missile Turret is intended as an elegant counter to cluster-fired missiles: it can fire very quickly for a short duration before entering a longer cooldown period, during which the ship carrying it is vulnerable. This tradeoff synergizes with the combat cadence of the Successors, who use it to cover their quick attack runs and endure the cooldown during the retreat phase."

	description "The engineers in the employ of the High Houses have developed this turret as a clever way of dealing with the heat produced by a ship's systems while in combat, conducting it along the particle beam generated by the weapon into a target. While it generates a substantial amount of resting heat, this weapon is capable of rapidly overheating an unprepared enemy ship. The High Houses often use it as a policing tool to force a target's reactor to shut down before preparing boarding parties."
