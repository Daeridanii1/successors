	description "This tiny shuttle is the smallest vessel operating in Successor space, and the first ship that new Successor pilots are able to get their arms on. Despite their small size, they are capable multipurpose vessels, and are frequently used for transporting passengers and cargo, and for short-duration research expeditions."
	description `	The design of the Kvelqde is, like most Successor vessels, based on originals from the time of the Predecessors. While the modern incarnation is nowhere near as advanced, successive generations of iteration with more limited resources have promoted the cost-efficiency and user-friendliess of the design.`

ship `Kvelqde` `Kvelqde (Naive)`
	description "This tiny shuttle is the smallest vessel operating in Successsor space, and appears to fulfill much the same role as the human shuttles with which you are familiar, transporting small groups of passengers and quantities of cargo throughout their space. While it has enough space to equip weapons if necessary, its limited internal space and the low energy density of civilian Successor generators make these hardpoints most suitable to mining rather than combat."

	description "Quick and comfortable, the Nnesaarau is among the newest designs utilized in Successor space, having first emerged from House Chydiyi's shipyards no more than twenty years ago. For various reasons, it is also among the least popular; it was designed solely as a luxury passenger transport and sees very little use outside that role because of its high price and restrictive internals. Nonetheless, some hotshot pilots swear by these as racing or fast courier vessels."

ship `Nnesaarau` `Nnesaarau (Naive)`
	description `These very light vessels don't have much room for passengers or cargo, but move swiftly and elegantly through Successor space. These qualities, combined with their high price and uncommon presence, suggest that these may be luxury craft of some sort, too impractical for use by the majority of Successors.`

	description `The "Myaede" is neither elegant nor fast, but it has remained the mainstay of Successor commerce since before the collapse of the old empire over a thousand years ago, boasting a spacious cargo hold, heavy armor, and a flexible enough weapons layout to let it fight back in a pinch. Much like the grand heirlooms of the High Houses, a familial "Myaede" is often passed down through the lineage of spacefaring low-born Successors, and many of the pilots flying these first took the helm as children under a grandparent's watchful gaze.`

	description `The "Myaede" is neither elegant nor fast, but has cemented itself as the backbone of Successor commerce with a spacious cargo hold, heavy armor, and a flexible enough weapons layout to let it fight back in a pinch. The design is robust and dependable; many of the ships you've seen appear old and worn but pass through the spaceport no less smoothly than their newer counterparts.`

	description `The Successors have a relatively small population and therefore are not in great need of large transport vessels. However, transporting passengers entirely by shuttle lacks a degree of comfort and security, so for longer journeys, the Successors use this dedicated transport ship. While unarmed by default, it is fast enough to escape most ships that might mean it harm.`

	description `Although it is the largest freighter employed by the Successors, the "Ojde" is still substantially smaller than large human freighters like the Bulk Freighter and Behemoth. While this limits the cargo capacity of any single ship, it also allows these vessels to be surprisingly fast and maneuverable and increases the number of facilities which can effectively tend to them.`
	description `Rather than built-in cargo holds, the "Ojde" is designed to carry an expandable rack of standardized cargo containers, increasing delivery and loading speed in busy spaceports.`

	description `While the High Houses do not sell their purpose-built warships to those who don't support their interests, the ubiquity and free space of the "Myaede" freighter has made it a relatively decent light weapons platform. The High Houses, of course, have better ships for this purpose, but independent agents and unoffical groups like the People's Houses do not.`

	description "The Successors have limited experience in making warships this small, and while their attempt at an interceptor is durable and sports a surprising amount of firepower for a ship of its size, it is also plagued with power and propulsion issues as most of their standard technology is either too large or not powerful enough to yield effective combat performance at this scale. The result is a ship that ambitious pilots call a challenge and prudent pilots call a deathtrap, but continues to see use as a patrol and escort vessel because of its speed and heavy armament."
	description `	The "Stolsaqra" also has the distinction of being the only purpose-built warship manufactured by the High Houses that is made available to the general public, albeit with significantly downgraded systems compared to the military-exclusive model.`

ship `Stolsaqra` `Stolsaqra (Naive)`
	description `The Successors' attempt at an interceptor is quite compact and sports a surprising amount of firepower for a ship of its size, though restrictive internal space leaves it plagued with power and propulsion issues if it is equipped to fully utilize its weapons capacity.

	description "This medium warship is among the oldest and most reliable designs employed by the High Houses of the Successors, with a recognizable lineage dating back several thousand years. It is compact, fast, and durable for a ship of its class, but has relatively limited internal space, and a short operational range. The captains of these ships are often up-and-coming Successor officers hoping to prove themselves to one of the High Houses by demonstrating their mastery of the vessel; while most, of course, do not, the ship's ubiquity and good performance make it an excellent starting point for those who do."

	description `Blessed with the honor of being named with the Successor word for swiftness, the "Veusade" is designed for one thing: to carry eight drag cannons as close to an enemy ship's hull as possible. The designers shaved off additional mass by excluding turret mounts; the presumption is that a pilot in one of these craft should be able to simply outmaneuver incoming missiles rather than going to the trouble of shooting them down.`
	description `	Such a narrowly-focused design makes these ships ill-suited for multipurpose use, but they are frequently seen as auxiliary or police craft, owing to their ability to rapidly catch and immobilize fleeing vessels. `

ship `Veusade` `Veusade (Naive)`
	description `The "Veusade" bristles with gun ports but has a small overall weapons capacity; in fact, it is just enough to saturate its hardpoints with drag cannons. Such a narrowly-focused design makes these ships ill-suited for multipurpose use, but they are frequently seen as auxiliary or police craft, owing to their ability to rapidly catch and immobilize fleeing vessels.`

	description `Serving as the heavy multipurpose backbone of the fleets of the various High Houses, the "Kaskhorade" trades some of the maneuverability of its smaller siblings for greater defenses and non-combat capabilities. In addition to being a capable warship, it also holds sizable free cargo and bunk space for use in a wide variety of missions. These vessels are frequently used to transport high-ranking members of the High Houses, as they can remain well-defended while outfitted for fast and luxurious travel.`

	description `As the largest production warship built by the shipyards of the High Houses for hundreds of years, the imposing "Valsaqra" is the Successors' vessel of choice when they need to send a strong message through violence or merely the threat thereof. The vessel bristles with weapon hardpoints and is unnervingly quick for a ship of its size; it would dance around any human battleship with ease. Naturally, the High Houses do not offer command of these vessels to any but their most trusted captains, and serving as the commander of one is generally considered the apex of a Successor naval officer's career.`
