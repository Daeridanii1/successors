	description "This tiny shuttle is the smallest vessel operating in Successor space, and the first ship that new Successor pilots are able to get their arms on. Despite their small size, they are capable multipurpose vessels, and are frequently used for transporting passengers and cargo, for short-duration research expeditions, and even as very light combat craft, capable of just barely fitting one fixed and one turreted pulse laser."

	description `The "Myaede" is neither elegant nor fast, but it has remained the mainstay of Successor commerce since before the collapse of the old empire over a thousand years ago, boasting a spacious cargo hold, heavy armor, and a flexible enough weapons layout to let it fight back in a pinch. Much like the grand heirlooms of the High Houses, a familial "Myaede" is often passed down through the lineage of spacefaring low-born Successors, and many of the pilots flying these first took the helm as children under a grandparent's watchful gaze.`

	description `The Successors have a relatively small population and therefore are not in great need of large transport vessels. However, transporting passengers entirely by shuttle can lack both security and comfort, so for longer journeys, the Successors use this dedicated transport ship. While unarmed by default, it is fast enough to escape most ships that might mean it harm.`

	description `Although little more than a "Myaede" attached to a rack of cargo containers and expanded drive section, the "Ojde" heavy freighter is nonetheless a time-proven and well-respected design that the Successors frequently use in their larger cargo convoys. As a direct result of the ponderous nature of the "Ojde," its design lacks fixed weaponry, instead defending itself with a high-coverage turret layout.`

	description `While the High Houses do not sell their purpose-built warships to those who don't support their interests, the ubiquity and free space of the "Myaede" freighter has made it a relatively decent light weapons platform. The High Houses, of course, have better ships for this purpose, but independent agents and unoffical groups like the People's Houses do not.`
	description `This particular "Myaede" is stripped-down to reduce mass, and most of its cargo space has been refitted to fit extra weapons and larger engines.`

	description "The Successors have limited experience in making warships this small, and while their attempt at an interceptor is durable and sports a surprising amount of firepower for a ship of its size, it is also plagued with power and propulsion issues as most of their standard technology is either too large or not powerful enough to yield effective combat performance at this scale. The result is a ship that ambitious pilots call a challenge and prudent pilots call a deathtrap, but continues to see use because of its heavy armament."

	description "This medium warship is among the oldest and most reliable designs employed by the High Houses of the Successors, with a recognizable lineage dating back several thousand years. It is compact, fast, and durable for a ship of its size, but has relatively limited internal space, and a short operational range. The captains of these ships are often up-and-coming Successor officers hoping to prove themselves to one of the High Houses by demonstrating their mastery of the vessel; while most, of course, do not, the ship's ubiquity and good performance make it an excellent starting point for those who do."

	description `The "Seiitej" is a light attack craft only recently put into production by the high houses of the Successors. While it carries a relatively light armament (by Successor standards), it is capable of outrunning any other ship in Successor space, making it excellent for hunting down traitors or fugitives. It also sees service as an escort in freighter convoys, and to that end, is capable of carrying a modest amount of cargo in its own right.`

	description `Blessed with the honor of being named with the Successor word for "fast," the "Veusade" is designed for one thing: to carry eight shatter cannons as close to an enemy ship's hull as possible. The designers shaved off additional mass by excluding turret mounts; the presumption is that a pilot in one of these craft should be able to simply outrun incoming missiles rather than going to the trouble of shooting them down. Such a narrowly-focused design makes these ships ill-suited for multipurpose use, but they are frequently seen as auxiliary or police craft, owing to their ability to rapidly catch and immobilize fleeing vessels. `

	description `Serving as the heavy multipurpose backbone of the fleets of the various High Houses, the "Kaskhorade" trades some of the maneuverability of its smaller siblings for greater defenses and non-combat capabilities. In addition to being a capable warship, it also holds sizable free cargo and bunk space for use in a wide variety of missions. These vessels are frequently used to transport high-ranking members of the High Houses, as they can remain well-defended while outfitted for fast and luxurious travel.`

	description `As the largest production warship built by the shipyards of the High Houses for hundreds of years, the imposing "Valsaqra" is the Successors' vessel of choice when they need to send a strong message through violence or merely the threat thereof. The vessel bristles with weapon hardpoints and is unnervingly quick for a ship of its size; it would dance around any human battleship with ease. Naturally, the High Houses do not offer command of these vessels to any but their most trusted captains, and serving as the commander of one is generally considered the apex of a Successor naval officer's career.`

	description `The New Houses do not have the sheer manufacturing volume of the Old Houses, and so they try to maintain their military relevance by employing unique designs. The "Joruuvaqra" is their largest success, a massive fighter carrier capable of unleasing a small fleet of heavily-armed fightercraft to aid it in combat or power projection. More than just a starship, it serves more like a mobile space station, capable of carrying a substantial amount of cargo and reserve crew in addition to its base loadout.`
