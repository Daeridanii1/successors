Perhaps, since we grew up under a harsh sun, the redundancy provided by our divorce from biological sex was beneficial to our evolution.`

It is from these devices that the music emanates.`
			`	One of the Successors in the pool begins to sing; at least, singing is the best way you could describe it: they press one of the longer and more cylindrical instruments up to their head and it begins producing an accompaniment to the other instruments' melody that your translation device occasionally recognizes as words:`

			`	It is not clear whether or not this represents the entire lyric content of the performance or simply if the translation device is unable to parse the more tonal phrases. The submerged singer displays a variety of colors and textures on their skin, changing with each successive phrase; green and rough on a splittingly high note, pink and smooth-looking on a strangely growl-like low section.
