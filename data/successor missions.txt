			`After trudging through several seemingly-dead systems, you've finally found a planet with living inhabitants. The aliens remind you most of octopi: they are substantially taller than you, rising up off of the ground by several long suckered arms. Their skin seems slightly wet and you can see it changing color and texture as several of them watch you, clearly perplexed by this strange visitor to their planet.`
			`   After examining you for some time, one of them, an especially tall and brightly colored individual wearing a uniform of some sort, begins to move towards you; they glide slowly and gently over the ground with an unsettling absence of noise. They say something in a strange sharply flowing language that you do not understand and wait expectantly for you to reply.`
			choice

				`Introduce yourself.`
			`   You introduce yourself to the alien, but their expression does not change to reveal any sort of understanding.`
			label end
			`   After a few moments of silence, the alien grunts in a gesture something like a sigh of disappointment and then turns away and says something to another uniformed individual in the now-gathering crowd. Their skin flashes a bright blue and then they leave, gliding towards one of the nearby ships parked at the spaceport.`
			`   When they return, they are holding a small round device which they hand to the individual in charge, who then offers it to you and burbles an unintelligible phrase with what you might have characterized as an encouraging tone.`
			`	You take it, and as soon as the device touches your skin, it begins to project a small but detailed star map of the area highlighting a system a few jumps north of here. The alien grunts energetically: it would appear that these people, whoever they are, want you to travel there.`

From what you can tell, they are similar in structure to large extended families of distantly related Successors: while only those of the central familial bloodline occupy noble positions, the vast majority of the members of any given house are low-born Successors who had an ancestor who was a member of the house at some point in their several-thousand-year continuous history.

			`In a similar manner to the last time, you set down your ship at a landing pad at the spaceport on this planet. Different to last time, however, you have been shuttled to a small, out-of-the way area at a great distance from the main complex, where several uniformed individuals are gathered on the landing pad, standing at attention.`
