			`After trudging through several seemingly-dead systems, you've finally found a planet with living inhabitants. The aliens remind you most of octopi: they are substantially taller than you, rising up off of the ground by several long suckered arms. Their skin seems slightly wet and you can see it changing color and texture as several of them watch you, clearly perplexed by this strange visitor to their planet.`
			`   After examining you for some time, one of them, an especially tall and brightly colored individual wearing a uniform of some sort, begins to move towards you; they glide slowly and gently over the ground with an unsettling absence of noise. They say something in a strange sharply flowing language that you do not understand and wait expectantly for you to reply.`

Their skin flashes a bright blue and then they leave, gliding towards one of the nearby ships parked at the spaceport.`
			`   When they return, they are holding a small round device which they hand to the individual in charge, who then offers it to you and burbles an unintelligible phrase with what you might have characterized as an encouraging tone.`
			`	You take it, and as soon as the device touches your skin, it begins to project a small but detailed star map of the area highlighting a system a few jumps north of here. The alien grunts energetically: it would appear that these people, whoever they are, want you to travel there.`

			`Once you have set down at the spaceport, you are met by another group of Successor naval officers. You notice that this group appears even more diverse than the last, representing several different uniform styles and liveries. Unifying them, however, is their wearing a small white and blue pin on their outfits that does not seem to correspond to the insignia of any one of the High Houses. They guide you, politely but firmly, to one of the monorail trains snaking out from the spaceport to other installations on the planet, and you all shuffle together into one of the cars, which appears to have been completely cleared of normal passengers.`
			`	Several minutes later, the monorail deposits you at an especially large and well-decorated complex that swarms with both military and well-dressed civilians, some of whom appear so opulent and bejewelled that you suspect their personal effects are worth more than your ship. Each of them without exception wears the same white and blue insignia as your escorts, though many have incorporated it into their clothes' design or even display it as a pattern in skin coloration. As your escort peels off into the crowd, you see a familiar face in the distance: Sieasej, the Successor scholar, who visibly perks up when they see you and approaches.`

			`	"Good! We would be wise to be early."`
			`	Together with Sieasej, you make your way to one of the smaller rooms branching off from the lobby. The doors open to reveal a garden-like area, filled with large long-leafed plants surrounding a centrally-located depression half-filled with water. Several Successors, many well-dressed like before, are gathered in the pool, and while Sieasej takes to it happily, you can't help but wince a little as the frigid water floods your boots.`
			`	After a few minutes and other Successors have trickled in, the meeting begins in earnest. One of the Successors moves to the center of the pool and addresses you directly.`
			`	"Captain. House Sioeora, who has supported thee with the gift of our translation device, and continues to recognize thy potential as an ally, wishes to recognize the good thy has done in our space, and proposes thy be awarded purchase rights for our general technology."`
			`	That representative then returns to the outer rim of the circle and another takes the center, this time facing the representative who just spoke.`
			`	"House Sioeora. House Chydiyi recognizes thy perspicacity and the value demonstrated by the captain, and supports thy proposal. The captain has proven themselves a valuable ally."`
			`	A third representative now takes the center position, addressing the two previous speakers.`
			`	"Houses Sioeora and Chydiyi. House Seineq proposes this alien be given no further rights nor gifts until they have proved themselves neutral. The Old Houses, which Sioeora and Chydiyi do today here represent, doth clearly seek to sway the alien's favor through brib'ry and deceit, and House Seineq stands with the New Houses in opposing this corruption."`
			`	That representative then returns to the edge of the circle, where they continue to eye you with suspicion. There is a pause in the conversation.`
			choice
				`	(Remain silent.)`
					goto silent
				`	"I have no interest in taking sides."`
					goto no
			label no
			`	This sparks some murmuring among the gathered Successors, both the representatives themselves and the other, quieter members who continue to stand around the periphery of the pool. There is no direct reply for some time until, after what seems like several minutes, the representative from House Seineq returns to the center and speaks.`
			`	"Guest. House Seineq recognizes thy noble words, even if we hold no reason for belief in them. We will permit the others to let thee buy our trinkets, and we shall watch thee closely to see if thy word is matched in action."`
			`	With no further comments from any of the Successors, the representative from House Sioeora calls for a vote from among the gathered representatives. Sioeora and Chydiyi vote for the proposition and Seineq abstains from the vote, remaining at the rim of the pool, inspecting your behavior closely. The representative from Sioeora then promptly produces another small box from within their outfit and presents it to you. You open it to reveal one of the pin insignias that you have seen throughout this meeting.`
			`	"This is the mark of our diplomats and our symbol of trust and cooperation. Our people may remain wary of an alien in their midst, but wherever thou displays this, it shall be known that thou hast recieved the blessing of the High Houses in council and that they made trade with you in amity and without fear. Do not abuse this trust."`
			`	With a somewhat suspicious air, Sioeora then leaves the room, followed by the other representatives and gathered members, all of whom keep their eyes focused on you on the way out. Eventually, when only ones remaining are Sieasej and yourself, you pin the insignia on your jacket beside the translation device and exit as well, when you are directed back to the monorail station.`

			`	It is somewhat relieving when you finally arrive at the planet and Kaatiora momentarily departs, once again carrying their more-than-armful of equipment and excitedly but carefully scanning the volcanic hot-water pools and small lakes around your landing site, occasionally exclaiming with excitement.`
			`	Eventually they return to your ship, satisfied with the amount of data they have collected, but still obviously energized by the experience.`

			`	Apart from that, we are a hermaphroditic species, like most from our home planet, and as we took to the stars, we learned that this is uncommon but not rare, and so there is some curiosity as to why our planet had such a diversity of such species while most do not. Perhaps, since we grew up under a harsh sun, the redundancy provided by our divorce from biological sex was beneficial to our evolution.`
			`	And of course, thou hast surely noticed by now the natural camouflage of our skin. While today its use its for communication, it was long ago a useful tool for evading predators who hunted by sight, until, of course, we gained the wisdom to outsmart our predators rather than hide from them."`

			`While waiting in the spaceport for the <ship> to be refueled, you notice that a small crowd of Successors is gathering around one of the pools of water that surround the starship hangars. Many are moving excitedly towards the commotion or, having already made it there, undulate strangely in the water.`
			choice
				`	(Investigate the gathering.)`
				`	(Ignore it.)`
					decline
			`	You walk through the water-covered floor to the group, and as you start to grow closer, you begin to hear music coming from the pool: a strange, lilting melody filled with notes that seem impossibly high or low or both at once. As you squeeze your way through the crowd, you see that in the pool there is a trio of submerged Successors, each of whom has their arms wrapped around one or several wildly distinct metal devices which protrude through the surface of the water. It is from these devices that the music emanates.`
			`	One of the Successors in the pool begins to sing; at least, singing is the best way you could describe it: they press one of the longer and more cylindrical instruments up to their head and it begins producing an accompaniment to the other instruments' melody that your translation device occasionally recognizes as words:`
			`	"... sweetest child ... never want ... not so ... somber current ... endure ..."`
			`	It is not clear whether or not this represents the entire lyric content of the performance or simply if the translation device is unable to parse the more tonal phrases. The submerged singer displays a variety of colors and textures on their skin, changing with each successive phrase; green and rough on a splittingly high note, pink and smooth-looking on a strangely growl-like low section. Several in the crowd emulate this in their own skin patterning; the group seems to throb with the melody of the music.`

			`	The music eventually crescendos to a long, droning wail of instrumentation with a rapid, high-pitched vocal performance that sees the water in the pool sloshing from side to side as the trio inside move rapturously, before coming to a close with a gentler and more playful section that sees the performers blowing bubbles to the surface and producing short, semi-random notes on their bizarre instruments.`

			`Nnesa and Jaasora have been simply enthralled on the journey here; the inseparable pair has spent seemingly every waking moment peering out the <ship>'s windows to watch the stars stream past. Upon arrival in the Maspa-Mavra system, however, their fervor dwindled to what you would call a subdued awe at the sight of the entire galaxy splayed out in the sky.`
			`	Khosa-Kella-Oa itself is cold, dark and rocky, another of the innumerable uninhabited airless worlds of the galaxy. Nnesa and Jaasora seem pleased with it, though, remarking that the local star "is so dim that there's hardly any glare!" They activate their cart of folded equipment in the <ship>'s cargo bay, which inflates and unfolds into something halfway between a tent and a repulsor lift, which smoothly glides over the floor like melting ice.`
			`	"Our thanks again, captain, for transporting us," says Jaasora, loading a bundle of telescopes into the tent.`
			`	"Oh! The planet's perfect; no air to muddy the view nor other ships to cloud the skies---"`

			`	The pair depart in their gliding tent, which manifests several transparent spots as it exits and as a bevy of telescopes are prodded around inside it.`
			choice
				`	(Wait.)`
			`	Nnesa and Jaasora return after a couple of hours, as promised, their tent gliding back into the <ship>'s cargo bay as smoothly as it exited. The pair unload several notebooks of photos and drawings and chatter excitedly about the various constellations and stellar phenomena that they observed. Nnesa is particularly excited, hurriedly extricating from the interleaved mess of papers a suprisingly well-constructed star map, which they press up in your face with pride. You cannot help but notice that several of the drawings in the stack are of Jaasora rather than any stellar phenomena.`

			`	Nnesa and Jaasora have marvelled at the stars just as much on the way back as they had on the way out, their enthusiasm undampened by any sense of fatigue. "Our deepest thanks, captain," Jaasora says to you once you have landed in the spaceport as Nnesa wrestles with the tent and cart. "'Twas a true and joyful voyage." Nnesa calls them over; the tent clearly needs two people to manage. Jaasora presents you with your payment of <payment> and goes to help, and the two of them maneuver their equipment out of your cargo bay before shouting a hasty but good-humored farewell.`
