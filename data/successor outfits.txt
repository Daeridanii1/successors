	"description" "Conformally applied right underneath a ship's hull, Successor defensive cortices are the end targets of shield or armor repair projections from small modular generators located deep within the vessel. Each projection that connects to a cortex can apply its shield regeneration or armor repair effects to the entire vessel, but increasing the number of projections too much reduces the efficiency of the system."
	description "	Altering a ship's shield geometry in this way tends to reduce its resistance to direct damage, however, which can be detrimental to the survivability of ships that rely on shielding as their main defensive layer."

	description "While the invertebrate Successors are relatively unaffected, human pilots must take care when using a reverse thruster this large to avoid dangerous g-force stress on the body."
	description "	Because a reverse thruster must be facing forwards, it must be installed in the weapon section of your ship instead of the engine section."

	description "Increased piracy in the western regions of Successor space have spurred interest in compact sidearms like this one, which uses the same technology as the Successors' ship-mounted pulse lasers, albeit on a much smaller scale. Specifically designed for repelling boarders, it is capable of interfacing with a Successor ship's computer and surveillance systems, routing target information to a built-in display."
