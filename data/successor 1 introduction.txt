			`After trudging through several seemingly-dead systems, you've finally found a planet with living inhabitants. As you enter the upper atmosphere, your ship is surrounded by a trio of interceptors and thoroughly scanned. Apparently satisfied, the lead ship transmits an unintelligible hail to you and slowly proceeds to a spaceport complex floating on a large structure on the planet's coast, where the group corrals you onto one of the few fully-dry landing pads. After several minutes, a small crowd begins to form around your landing site.`
			`	The aliens remind you most of octopi: they are substantially taller than you, rising up off of the ground by several long suckered arms. Their skin seems slightly wet and you can see it changing color and texture as several of them watch you through their hourglass-shaped pupils.`
			`   After examining you for some time, one of them, an especially tall and brightly colored individual wearing a uniform of some sort, begins to move towards you; they glide slowly and gently over the ground with an unsettling absence of noise. They say something in the strange sharply flowing language that you heard over the hail and wait expectantly for you to reply.`

			`	You draw your weapon and fire a shot directly at the center of the uniformed alien, but it does not even manage to scorch the fabric of their clothing. Before you have time to fire a second, there is an unfathomably loud noise that pushes you back and leaves you dead before your body even makes contact with the ground.`

			`   After a few more moments of silence, the alien grunts in a gesture something like a sigh of disappointment and then turns away and says something to another uniformed individual in the now-substantial crowd. Their skin flashes a bright blue and then they leave, gliding towards one of the interceptors now parked alongside your ship at the spaceport.`
			`   When they return, they are holding a small round device which they hand to the individual in charge, who then in turn offers it to you and burbles an unintelligible phrase with what you might have characterized as an encouraging tone. Several individuals in the crowd by now appear to be taking pictures of the two of you, and you can see more of them gliding towards your landing site in the distance.`
			`	You take the device from the alien, and as soon as it touches your skin, it begins to project a small but detailed holographic star map of the area highlighting a system a few jumps east of here. The alien grunts energetically as the trio of interceptors begins to hover in preparation for takeoff: it would appear that these people, whoever they are, want you to travel there.`

			`In a similar manner to the last time, you set down your ship at a landing pad at the spaceport on this planet, escorted by the interceptors. Different to last time, however, you have been shuttled to a small, out-of-the way area at a great distance from the main complex, where several uniformed individuals are gathered on the landing pad, standing at attention.`
			`	After waiting for several minutes, a shuttle lands on the pad beside yours and several individuals emerge from it. One of them is moving more quickly than the rest, and the guards allow them to pass and approach you. Their skin changes to a rough brown before they begin to speak.`

			`Once you have set down at the spaceport, you are met by another group of Successor naval officers. You notice that this group appears even more diverse than the last, representing several different uniform styles and liveries. Unifying them, however, is their wearing a small white and blue pin on their outfits that does not seem to correspond to the insignia of any one of the High Houses. They guide you, politely but firmly, to one of the monorail trains snaking out from the spaceport to other installations on the planet, and you all shuffle together into one of the cars, which appears to have been completely cleared of normal passengers.`
			`	Several minutes later, the monorail deposits you at an especially large and well-decorated complex that swarms with both military and well-dressed civilians, some of whom appear so opulent and bejewelled that you suspect their personal effects are worth more than your ship. Each of them without exception wears the same white and blue insignia as your escorts, though many have incorporated it into their clothes' design or even display it as a pattern in skin coloration. As your escort peels off into the crowd, you see a familiar face in the distance: Sieasej, the Successor scholar, who visibly perks up when they see you and approaches.`

I had told thou when we first met that they would be keeping their eyes upon thee, and since they have summoned thou here today, they must clearly want to involve thee in the next stage of their plans."`

			`	Sieasej briefly turns a shade of green in a display you might almost characterize as blushing. "I was summoned as well. I suspect the Houses wish to reflect on my involvement as well."`

				`	"Indeed. I'm ready to begin, then."`
					goto start
			label start
			`	"Good! We would be wise to be early."`
			`	Together with Sieasej, you make your way to one of the smaller rooms branching off from the lobby. The doors open to reveal a garden-like area, filled with large long-leafed plants surrounding a centrally-located depression half-filled with water. Several Successors, many well-dressed like before, are gathered in the pool, and while Sieasej takes to it happily, you can't help but wince a little as the frigid water floods your boots.`
			`	After a few minutes and other Successors have trickled in, the meeting begins in earnest. One of the Successors moves to the center of the pool and addresses you directly.`
			`	"Captain. House Sioeora, who has supported thee with the gift of our translation device, and continues to recognize thy potential as an ally, wishes to recognize the good thy has done in our space, and proposes thy be awarded purchase rights for our general technology."`
			`	That representative then returns to the outer rim of the circle and another takes the center, this time facing the representative who just spoke.`
			`	"House Sioeora. House Chydiyi recognizes thy perspicacity and the value demonstrated by the captain, and supports thy proposal. The captain has proven themselves a valuable ally."`
			`	A third representative now takes the center position, addressing the two previous speakers.`
			`	"Houses Sioeora and Chydiyi. House Seineq proposes this alien be given no further rights nor gifts until they have proved themselves neutral. The Old Houses, which Sioeora and Chydiyi do today here represent, doth clearly seek to sway the alien's favor through brib'ry and deceit, and House Seineq stands with the New Houses in opposing this corruption."`
			`	That representative then returns to the edge of the circle, where they continue to eye you with suspicion. There is a pause in the conversation.`
			choice
				`	(Remain silent.)`
					goto silent
				`	"I have no interest in taking sides."`
					goto no
			label no
			`	This sparks some murmuring among the gathered Successors, both the representatives themselves and the other, quieter members who continue to stand around the periphery of the pool. There is no direct reply for some time until, after what seems like several minutes, the representative from House Seineq returns to the center and speaks.`
			`	"Guest. House Seineq recognizes thy noble words, even if we hold no reason for belief in them. We will permit the others to let thee buy our trinkets, and we shall watch thee closely to see if thy word is matched in action."`
			`	With no further comments from any of the Successors, the representative from House Sioeora calls for a vote from among the gathered representatives. Sioeora and Chydiyi vote for the proposition and Seineq abstains from the vote, remaining at the rim of the pool, inspecting your behavior closely. The representative from Sioeora then promptly produces another small box from within their outfit and presents it to you. You open it to reveal one of the pin insignias that you have seen throughout this meeting.`
			`	"This is the mark of our diplomats and our symbol of trust and cooperation. Our people may remain wary of an alien in their midst, but wherever thou displays this, it shall be known that thou hast recieved the blessing of the High Houses in council and that they made trade with you in amity and without fear. Do not abuse this trust."`
			`	With a somewhat suspicious air, Sioeora then leaves the room, followed by the other representatives and gathered members, all of whom keep their eyes focused on you on the way out. Eventually, when only ones remaining are Sieasej and yourself, you pin the insignia on your jacket beside the translation device and exit as well, when you are directed back to the monorail station.`
