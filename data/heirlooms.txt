	description "During the collapse of the Predecessors' empire, the high houses stored away as much of their wealth and property as they could manage, including their private fleets of warships, which were ultimately passed down for over a thousand years as priceless family heirlooms. Despite being far more powerful than anything else in Successor space, these vessels almost never leave the ground, since the high houses have no desire to risk these priceless and irreplacable ships that are so deeply intertwined with their family history."

	description `This weapon is, in its basic principle, no different from the beam lasers produced in human space by Deep Sky. What distinguishes it from those weapons is that this one uses more energy in a single shot than a mid-sized city does in a year, and that the beam it produces is more than sufficient to level that city and the surrounding countryside. Naturally, no ship has the battery capacity necessary to fire one of these from its on-board reserves, so the Successors have resorted to powering them via massive single-use batteries. Unsurprisingly, these weapons are not used carelessly, nor are they distributed among the general populace.`

	description `The Predecessors viewed the mastery of technology as an art rather than a science, and this reactor is a perfect example of that: a graceful, elegant machine easily mistaken for a sculpture. It is also, of course, an extremely efficient and powerful fusion reactor that far outstrips the modern Successors' attempts at replicating it.`

	"description" "One of the nastier inventions of the Predecessors were these miniaturized auto-targeting killer drones, which they used as a defense system on their ships. When intruders are detected, thousands of these will pour out of bulkhead-mounted sockets and hunt down any life-form not entered into their biometric friendlies list, targeting organs if possible but simply perforating the target hundreds of times as a fallback strategy."
