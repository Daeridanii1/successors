	description "During the collapse of the Predecessors' empire, the high houses stored away as much of their wealth and property as they could manage, including their private fleets of warships, which were ultimately passed down for over a thousand years as priceless family heirlooms. Despite being far more powerful than anything else in Successor space, these vessels almost never leave the ground, since the high houses have no desire to risk these priceless and irreplacable ships that are so deeply intertwined with their family history."

	description `The largest and most powerful of the Successors' weapons, this massive railgun propels its magnetic projectiles to a sizeable fraction of the speed of light, delivering enough kinetic energy on impact to destroy a small city or alternatively, a large warship. Any vessel sturdy enough to survive even a single hit will likely have to reboot its power systems as well, as the powerful magnetic fields surrounding the projectiles are highly disruptive to electronics.`

	description `This unit contains not only one of the high-velocity projectiles used by the Kinetic Lance, but also the massive single-use battery banks used to provide enough energy to power the railgun. Unfortunately for the High Houses, the techniques for constructing these have been lost to time and there are therefore only a limited number in their reserves.`

It is also, of course, an extremely efficient and powerful fusion reactor that far outstrips the modern Successors' attempts at replicating it.`

	"description" "One of the nastier inventions of the Predecessors were these miniaturized auto-targeting killer drones, which they used as a defense system on their ships. When intruders are detected, thousands of these will pour out of bulkhead-mounted sockets and hunt down any life-form not entered into their biometric friendlies list, targeting organs if possible but simply perforating the target hundreds of times as a fallback strategy."
