	description "While today the planet is geologically stable, it experienced major tectonic shifts in the past, folding the planet's surface into a number of visually spectacular canyons and mountain ranges. Since it serves such an important political role, tectonic activity on this planet is closely monitored, and even though there have been no major earthquakes since the Successors settled here, most of the buildings here are built to withstand even large and destructive geological shifts."
	spaceport "Surprisingly small for a planet of this importance, the spaceport on Aava-Aasa-Khora is composed of a number of small buildngs made out of surprisngly flexible materials. While the sensation of the landing pad bowing under your ship's weight is unsettling to say the least, it shows no signs of damage or structural fatigue."
	spaceport "The inside of the spaceport is very similar, with soft, rounded shapes, and flexible building materials. The floor seems to sink a little as you step on it, almost like it is actually a viscous liquid rather than a solid material."

Furthermore, its lack of substantial natural resources exempted it from use as an industrial or mining planet, and it continues to remain uninhabited."

Beneath the permafrost lie rich deposits of rare earth elements and heavy metals that have formed and supported a highly self-contained economy, with entire production lines from raw material to final product contained within this single planet. Since many of the minerals mined here are integral for the production of the Successors' advanced composite materials, the New Houses keep a tight grip here, funneling many of the end products into their shipyards and construction projects."
	description "Kasii-Cavasaa-Oa is also the home of House Kvasq, one of the New Houses."
	spaceport "Far from beautiful, but impressive in its scale and technology, Kasii-Cavasaa-Oa's spaceport looms over the blindingly-white snow hills like an obsidian outcrop. There is a substantial military presence here, guarding the valuable freight convoys of the New Houses; even in these relatively peaceful times, the Successors have clearly not forgotten their fraught and warlike past."

	description "When the New Houses immigrated to this area of space after the collapse of their Predecessors' empire, many existing space stations were rapidly converted from industrial or scientific purposes to temporary habitation. While most of these were converted back as the New Houses settled the south of Successor space, this station was not."
	description `Despite extensive efforts by the New Houses, it remains overcrowded, poorly-maintained, and a haven for crime, with many of its inhabitants either unable to leave because of lack of funding, or unwilling to leave because of ties to family or to the so-called "People's Houses," semi-familial groups lauded by the residents as effective democratic governments but denigrated by the High Houses as little more than gangs of populist thugs.`
	spaceport `You wouldn't really call the landing area here a "spaceport:" it seems to be just an especially large cargo bay refitted to hold a handful of ships. In sharp contrast to most of the Successor facilities you've visited, it is grimy, dingy, and uncomfortably claustrophobic - throngs of Successors squeeze in between crowded starships, overflowing cargo containers, and strewn-about equipment, and most of these items display bullet holes, scorch marks, or other conditions not evocative of confidence.`
	spaceport "At the edges of the spaceport, several semi-obfuscated elevators and blast doors lead out into the rest of the station. While most of these, you presume, lead to residential areas, some seem to be servicing the seedier side of the population, and you can't help but wonder how much of the spaceport's operations are taking place behind closed doors."

For the highly familial Successors, this is a relatively small proportion, and consequently the planet only supports around twenty thousand inhabitants, though it has the highest population growth of any planet in Successor space. Most agree that this is a result of frustration with the bickering between the high houses, but it is commonly joked that it is instead a consequence of supposed especially amorous tendencies among the local population."
	spaceport "The mountainside spaceport here is tiny and almost deserted, and the Successors who guide your ship to its dirt landing pad seem to disappear entirely immediately after you've touched down. While there are a few small shops and trading posts scattered around the area, none of them make any effort to get your attention, and a few are even completely automated, with nothing more than a few inoffensively blinking lights indicating that they are functional and open for business."

This planet contains rich natural deposits of the raw materials required for the manufacturing of their composites, and consequently, it serves as both a center for the mining of these materials and as the industrial core of Successor space."
	description "Because Khora-Vasa-Reyyaa falls within the sphere of influence of the Old Houses, many in the New Houses are very concerned about the power imbalance this creates, and several treaties are in place ensuring fair and open exports from the planet."
	description "Khora-Vasa-Reyyaa is also home to the familial seat of House Chydiyi, one of the Old Houses."
	spaceport "The spaceport here is perhaps the most militarized of any you have visited in Successor space. Large industrial buildings rise up around the landing pads, casting them into deep shadow, and several small Successor warships stand ready on fast-launch pads, ready to enter orbit at a moment's notice. You pass through a security checkpoint on your way into the spaceport proper, and while the security officers have clearly been briefed to expect alien visitors, they still regard you with some degree of scrutiny."

The low gravity here is greatly appreciated by the Successors, and consequently the moon supports a sizable population despite its small size, most of whom live in several cities along the equator."
	description "It is also the seat of power for House Aqrabe, one of the Old Houses. Despite this categorization, House Aqrabe has remained neutral in most of the Successors' conflicts over the millenia, and continues to present itself as an unbiased and politically uncommitted member of the High Houses which, combined with the central position of this star system, has led House Aqrabe to form strong connections with the New Houses as well as the Old."
	spaceport "The spaceport is large but efficient, and plastered in bright and friendly colors, much like the landscape surrounding it. Most of the buildings are organic in shape, arcing and bubbling from place to place like seafoam, and despite the fanciful design, they also appear to be servicing a large volume of travellers, merchants, and military personnel, with color-coded lines leading to different areas."

Most of this is contained within its many cities, but recently, it has become a destination for Successors who want to return to a simpler and more peaceful way of life, and so there are several smaller settlements dotting the surface, each occupied by one or more large extended family groups."

The gently sloping sides of the crater have been excavated and rows upon rows of starship hangars have been built in them, offering an impressive view at the port's operation to the pilots who make use of it.

The high houses are understandably somewhat perturbed by this autonomy, but have allowed independent commerce to continue here in exchange for levying modest taxes on transactions that do not go through their official channels."
	spaceport "The spaceport is large and busy, situated at the foot of a mountain, and seems more haphazard than most Successor spaceports you've seen. Small shops and tents sit abreast advertisements for the latest generation of Pulse Laser and statues of important figures in the high houses, many of which seem weather-worn and unmaintained."

Despite that, the Successors have discovered very simple life forms here, possibly the very first life that has developed on this planet. Consequently, it is of some interest to Successor biologists, or at least the ones willing to brave the toxic and destructive conditions on the surface."

	description "This moon is the collective seat of what are known as the New Houses, the noble families who traveled through the wormhole to this region of space during the collapse of the Predecessors' empire. Many within the New Houses object to that moniker, arguing that their family lines are in fact the more extensive and noble and that they should be categorized by that rather than by their time of arrival."
	description "Despite population surges in recent years, O-Vasa-Oa remains relatively sparsely populated. The tidal forces from the planet it orbits create high winds that sweep across the landscape, making settlement challenging in undeveloped areas, and expensive even in those that have the infrastructure to support it."
	spaceport "The spaceport is built right on top of a large shipyard, allowing visitors to look on at the impressive manufacturing apparatus of the New Houses while going about their business. Despite its relatively small size, the spaceport is very busy, with ships constantly launching and landing and a general air of haste among all the Successors you see."

	description "Raaqa-Kvelq-Ryuit was the very first planet in this area of space to be colonized by the Successors' ancestors, and today it boasts a population of over one billion inhabitants, the largest of any planet in Successor space. Its famously mild and forgiving weather supports a strong agricultural economy, and the landscape is dotted with farms both large and small. The primary export of the planet is a long, stringy plant most reminiscent of seaweed, which the Successors consider a staple and consume great quantities of."
	description "Raaqa-Kvelq-Ryuit is also familial seat to House Myurej, one of the Old Houses."
	spaceport "The spaceport is located right on the equator and is a massive, sprawling affair with several enormous racks of cargo containers stretching out into the distance, clearly awaiting export on soon-arriving freighters. The ground is wet from a sprinkler system that maintains a constant thin film of water all throughout the spaceport's exterior. The Successors, lacking shoes, must appreciate this for reducing friction between their arms and the relatively uncomfortable and rough concrete."

	description "After the collapse, many Successors found themselves without a family, or without the knowledge of unbroken lineage that others took comfort in. House Kaatrij, which had lost many of its scions in the collapse, took the previously unprecedented step of welcoming these otherwise-outcasts into its familial order, earning its reputation as perhaps the most open and progressive of the High Houses. While it still remains the smallest of the High Houses, it has also done the best job of preserving and growing its wealth, and has earned a reputation as an unpredictable power player largely separated from the Old/New divide."
	description "Its home planet is small, rainy, and mostly covered by ocean. Widely regarded as one of the most beautiful planets in Successor space, settlement here is tightly regulated by House Kaatrij."
	spaceport "Upon setting down, the landing pad releases a billowing sheet of clear water-repellant material that covers your ship, presumably as some sort of protection against the rain. The spaceport itself is low and small and decorated with strips of the same material that gently ruffle in the wind, almost like the sails of an ancient ocean-going ship."
	spaceport "The few Successors you see appear attentive to but not surprised by your presence, clearly already well-informed about the arrival of the new alien traveler."

	description "Unlike most of the Predecessors' planets, this one remains relatively habitable. Its large forests have fluorished in the absence of sapient life, and the stark remains of Predecessor cities are slowly being reclaimed by nature. While the materials the buildings are made of have not decayed an iota in over a thousand years, the tender shoots of green life nontheless adhere to and worm their way through them."
	spaceport "What was once the spaceport is now a field of flowers. Small blue ones sprout from the landing pads; spiky orange ones jut from empty countertops, a calm but firm reminder of the supremacy of life over the once-living."

	landscape land/space7
	description "With Raaqa-Aa-Ryuit serving such an enormous volume of trade, it eventually became economically feasible to establish an orbiting station as an ancillary port for all the freighter captains who preferred not to go to the trouble of making a landing on the planet. Rather than building an entirely new station, the High Houses chose to disassemble an old industrial station from the now-abandoned industrial systems in the south of Successor space and transport it here. This ended up costing much more than projected, and with the planets in their star cluster more than sufficient to house their population, the Successors have refrained from building or transporting any other stations for over a hundred years."
	spaceport "The zero-G environment makes landing and the loading and unloading of cargo relatively easy compared to planetside, and it's no surprise that the spaceport is busy but efficient. Everyone here is in a hurry, and while the Successors that you speak to are happy to help and trade, it's clear that there are several demands on their time."

	description "Despite its favorable location in Successor space, Shassa-Wyra-Orrou is only sparsely inhabited: the hot stars it orbits make its surface temperature a little too warm for most Successors. Even so, there are some small settlements in the polar regions, mostly populated by mining families taking advantage of the rich mineral wealth of both the planet and the surrounding system."
	spaceport "The spaceport is built on a large rock beach in the northern hemisphere, with a number of large fabric shades covering important areas. A substantial portion of the port is devoted to offloading mined items, and surprisingly, there is also a large and healthily-populated tourist section, which is displaying several particularly attractive stones, no doubt locally mined."

	description "Staja-Kella-Oa is widely recognized as the location of the best educational institutions in Successor space, most of which are funded by the Old Houses but accept applications from all Successors regardless of birthplace or family history."
	description "The planet itself is densely forested with a few small cities. Part of the reason that it continues to be a center for education is that it has a rich archaelogical history: this planet was home to a now presumed-extinct sapient species roughly one hundred thousand years ago, and there is a great deal of interest in uncovering the details of their society."
	description "Staja-Kella-Oa is also home to the ancestral estate of House Sioeora, one of the Old Houses."
	spaceport "The dense tree cover shades the landing pads of the spaceport and casts the whole area in dappled light that reflects softly off the moving ships. Much of the traffic at the spaceport is small shuttles and transports carrying Successor students to and from the planet; the interior of it is clean and colorful, and seems directed towards its more youthful audience, with several recruiting posters for the fleets of the various high houses plastered on the walls."

	description "As it was only very recently settled by the Successors, this large and rocky moon supports only a small population, most of whom are military personnel for the Old Houses and who live underground to avoid the powerful electrical storms on the surface. Though an undeniably hostile and uncomfortable place, the location of its star system has made it an ideal staging point for the fleets of the Old Houses to keep an eye on trade in nearby systems, and the persistent electrical storms on the surface serve to mask the energy signatures of their vessels."
	spaceport "As a civilian, you are directed to a smaller port off to the side of one of the larger military ones. As soon as your ship touches down, the landing pad is lowered into an underground hangar and sealed off from the violent atmosphere. While this is an effective protection against the storms, you can't help but notice how it also means that you are trapped here until traffic control decides to release you."

	spaceport "The spaceport, if you can call it that, is nothing more than an approximately flat area in a mountain valley with a small research base serving as a control tower. The air outside is bitterly cold, and while the Successors do not seem to mind it as much as you, even they express discomfort at being out in the open for too long."

Nonetheless, it supports a rich and biodiverse planetary ecosystem, with large jungles straddling its equatorial regions that give way to strikingly beautiful mountain ranges near the poles. It serves as both one of the most popular tourist locations in Successor space, and as a major shipyard planet for the New Houses."

Because of the thick atmosphere, much of the transport in and out is by air, and there is a near-constant drone of airplane and airship engines layered over the normal spaceport chatter. Several large tourist groups are moving to and fro, and while some regard you with surprise, most take no notice of you or your ship, already focused on their upcoming tour or expedition."
